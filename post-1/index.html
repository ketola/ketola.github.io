	<p>OK, I got the blog started. I was initially planning to store the files in AWS in S3 bucket but then
I came across <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and I thought I'd give it a try.</p>
<p>I had already decided to implement this using static site generation. I went with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>.
As it seemed to be pretty modern and still simple. I used this 6 minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzf9A9tkkl4">tutorial</a> to get started.</p>
<p>The css for the page I asked from ChatGPT, as I have no skills in design.</p>
